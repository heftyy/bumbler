# bumbler

This project was created with intentions of learning c++11 and boost.
I also wanted to write a library for multithreading and networking using the actor model after using Akka for java.

Client and server applications are simple examples of usage of the library.

The library is in [shared/atan](https://github.com/heftyy/bumbler/tree/master/docs) ( i need to find a good name for it ).
