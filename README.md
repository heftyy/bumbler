# bumbler

This project was created with intentions of learning c++11 and boost.
I also wanted to write a message driven library for multithreading and networking after i used Akka for java.

Client and server applications are simple examples of usage of the library.

The library is in [src/bumbler](https://github.com/heftyy/bumbler/tree/master/docs).
