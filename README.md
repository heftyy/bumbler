This project was created with intentions of learning c++11 and boost.
I also wanted to write a library for multithreading and networking using the actor model after using Akka for java.

Client and server applications are simple examples of usage of the library. 

The library is in [shared/atan](https://www.github.com) ( i need to find a good name for it ).

TODO:
 * create more interesting client/server examples
 * split CMakeLists into subprojects
