# bumbler

This project was created with intentions of learning c++11 and boost.
I also wanted to write a message driven library for multithreading and networking after i used Akka for java.

Client and server applications are simple examples of usage of the library.

Basic documentation [src/bumbler](/docs).

toolchains tested:
* gcc >= 4.9
* msvc 14

dependencies:
* cmake >= 3.2
* Qt >= 5.5
* google protocol buffers >= 2.6.1
* gtest & gmock
* doxygen (only if you want to use make doc)
